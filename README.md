## 🚀 What is CryptoLoops?

CryptoLoops is a next-generation, institutional-grade analytics engine for **predictive arbitrage loop detection** across 14+ blockchains.  
It leverages proprietary temporal graph algorithms, deep-time pattern recognition, and real-time simulation to surface high-confidence trading opportunities **before they happen**.

> **This is not your average crypto dashboard. This is a new trick—unknown to most, operating at “goat universe” level.**

## 🧠 Why is this Different?

- **Temporal Loop Detection:**  
  Not just technical analysis, but behavioral topology—detecting recurring transactional loops with 92.7% backtested accuracy.

- **Quantum-Inspired Engine:**  
  Proprietary transformer models and hypergraph analytics, trained on 8.4PB of historical chain data.

- **Institutional-Grade Simulation:**  
  Monte Carlo execution, Bayesian scoring, and real-time volatility amplification modeling.

- **Live Terminal Demo:**  
  Experience the engine in action with a cinematic, draggable, PowerShell-style terminal modal.  
  Type `help`, `scan`, `wallets`, and more—see the future of trading analytics.
